##TODO:

- Move battle feature out of the home screen
- Randomized character must be randomized and fetched from the API, so that every possible character can be picked:
You can get a single character by adding the id as a parameter: /character/2

- Improve UI of battle mode
- Improve UI of each card? Maybe when hovered over card should somehow get bigger or shine?
